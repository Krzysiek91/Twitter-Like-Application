# Twitter-Like-App

  Applicatiton that I have made during Coders Lab Coding Bootcamp. 

  The goal was to write an application similar to Twitter using PHP.

  The view was created with the Bootstrap framework.
	

  Application features:
  
  - creating new user account
  - adding new tweets for looged user
  - adding comments to tweets
  - sending messages to other users

* not logged users may only display tweets
